# 💻 C++ Modules

A deep dive into the **C++98** standard to understand the core mechanics of the language before moving to modern standards.

This project was developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.

### 🛠️ Core Concepts Learned

- **Orthodox Canonical Class Form** (Default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructor).
    
- **Memory Management** (Stack vs Heap, New/Delete, Deep vs Shallow copies).
    
- **Polymorphism** (Ad-hoc, Subtype polymorphism, Abstract classes, and Interfaces).
    
- **Templates** (Function and Class templates, Template specialization).
    
- **STL** (Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms).

### 🚀 How to Run

Each exercise comes with its own `Makefile`. To compile and run an exercise:

1. Navigate to the exercise directory:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd cppXX/exXX
    ```
    
2. Compile using `make`:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    make
    ```
    
3. Launch the executable:
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    ./executable_name
    ```
    

### 📋 Requirements

- **Compiler**: `c++`
    
- **Flags**: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`
